# Flow in the Kubernetes

- Creating an application inside Kubernetes
- Processing the User Request and returnig the Response
- Managing the Application State

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown from creating a Pod for your application to handling a user request and sending back a response.

### 1. Deploying the Application Pod

- **Step 1: Create a Manifest File**
  Write a Kubernetes manifest (YAML) file for your application. This file will define resources like a Deployment (to manage your Pods) and a Service (to expose your application).

- **Step 2: Apply the Manifest File**
  Use below commnd to submit the manifest file to Kubernetes. This command interacts with the API Server.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f your_manifest.yaml
  ```

- **Step 3: API Server Stores and Validates**
  The API Server validates the manifest file and saves the desired state in etcd.

- **Step 4: Scheduler Assigns a Node**
  The Scheduler detects that a new Pod is required and assigns it to an available Worker Node based on resource availability.

- **Step 5: Kubelet Creates the Pod**
  The Kubelet on the selected worker node receives instructions from the API Server to create the Pod. It pulls the required container image (e.g., from Docker Hub) using the Container Runtime Interface (such as Docker or containerd) and starts the container(s) in the Pod.

### 2. Exposing the Application to Users

- **Step 6: Service Creation**
  A Service (e.g., NodePort, LoadBalancer, or ClusterIP) is created as defined in the manifest. This Service makes the application accessible within the cluster (or externally if using NodePort/LoadBalancer).

- **Step 7: Kube-Proxy Enables Communication**
  The Kube-Proxy on each node manages network rules so that requests to the Service’s IP are directed to the appropriate Pod(s). It handles load balancing across multiple Pods if there are multiple replicas.

### 3. User Request Flow

- **Step 8: User Sends a Request**
  A user initiates a request to the application, typically using the Service’s external IP or domain name, which maps to the Service’s IP (if it’s exposed externally).

- **Step 9: Request Routed to the Pod**
  The request reaches the Service, which uses Kube-Proxy to forward the request to one of the available Pods (based on load-balancing rules).

- **Step 10: Pod Processes the Request**
  The Pod’s container(s) handle the incoming request, executing the necessary application logic, database queries, etc., to process the request.

- **Step 11: Response Returned to User**
  The application within the Pod generates a response, which travels back through the Service and is routed back to the user over the same path.

### 4. Maintaining Application State

- **Step 12:Monitoring and Maintaining Desired State**
  The Controller Manager continuously monitors the application’s desired state (as defined in the Deployment manifest). If a Pod fails, the Controller Manager detects the discrepancy through the API Server and initiates a replacement Pod by informing the Scheduler. The Scheduler finds an available node, and the Kubelet on that node creates a new Pod to maintain the desired state.
  This flow ensures that your application is not only deployed but also consistently available and responsive to user requests, even in cases of Pod or node failures.
