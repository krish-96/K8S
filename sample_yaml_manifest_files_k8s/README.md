## Kubernetes manifest files

- This directory will have manifest files for the kubernetes pods, deployment and services.
- Since we have used, nginx to play with kubernetes pods, deployment and services, it doesn't require to build the
  images.
- All the nginx images are available on the docker, it'll pull from there itself.

### Manifest files:

- [pod](pod.yaml)
- [deployment](deploy.yaml)
- [service](service_node_port.yaml)
